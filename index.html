            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>The Ocicat is an all-domestic breed of cat which resembles a wild cat but has no wild DNA in its gene
                pool. The breed is unusual in that it is spotted like a wild cat but has the temperament of a domestic
                animal. It is named for its resemblance to the ocelot. The breed was established from the Siamese and
                Abyssinian. American Shorthair was also added to the original crosses due to an error in the Cat
                Fanciers' Association, Inc's recording of the breeds used. This mix of breeds created a healthy, large
                breed of cat completely different in type and appearance from the source breeds.</p>

        <section class="history">
            <h1>History</h1>
            <p>The first breeder of Ocicats was Virginia Daly, of Berkley, Michigan, who attempted to breed an
                Abyssinian-pointed Siamese in 1964. The first generation of kittens appeared Abyssinian, but the result
                in the second generation was not only the Abyssinian-pointed Siamese but also a spotted kitten, Tonga,
                nicknamed an "ocicat" by the breeder's daughter. Tonga was neutered and sold as a pet, but further
                breedings of his parents produced more spotted kittens, and became the basis of a separate Ocicat
                breeding program. Other breeders joined in and used the same recipe, Siamese to Abyssinian, and
                offspring to Siamese. In addition, due to an error by CFA in recording the cross that produced the
                Ocicat, the American Shorthair was introduced to the Ocicat giving the breed larger boning and adding
                silver to the 6 colors. The Ocicat was initially accepted for registration in The Cat Fanciers'
                Association, Inc., and was moved into Championship for showing in 1987. Other registries followed. Today
                the Ocicat is found all around the world, popular for its all-domestic temperament but wild appearance.
                The Ocicat was named by Virginia's daughter, Virginia E. Daly.</p>

        <section class="temperament">
            <h1>Temperament</h1>
            <p>Ocicats have inherited personality traits from both Siamese and Abyssinians, two breeds considered to be
                domesticated for many thousands of years. They will often greet your guests, and are friendly and
                sociable. They are ideal pets for most households, generally tolerating gentle children and other pets.
                Their temperament is often described as that of a "dog in a cat's body". Most can be trained to fetch,
                walk on a leash and harness, come when called, speak, sit, lie down on command and other canine-style
                tricks. Some even take readily to water. Most are especially agile and are motivated by play with
                toys. Given these attributes, the Ocicat requires more attention from its owners than most breeds. They
                do get along well with other animals and people, however, and appreciate an animal companion to keep
                them company if left alone for any length of time.</p>
